# Slightly Altered Terrain Generation

Licenced under MIT


## What is this:

This mod slightly alters the terrain generation to add some more variety to the terrain. 
 Without going overboard and making everything amplified, it makes the terrain a bit more interesting.

 

## What it is Technically doing:

Biomes have a depth and scale parameter that defines the shape of them (It's what makes mountains tall or plains flat).   
This mod steals another biomes scale and depth when generating the world to create some more variety.   
You will still get flat plains and tall mountains. Most of the time you won't notice much of a difference. 
But occasionally, you'll see a plains mountain or a surprisingly tall dark forest.

**Some standard looking terrain - It's mostly normal!  So not everything is crazy!**
